1. Scope (Where the variable lives)

        a. var is Function-Scoped: If you create a var inside a loop or an if statement, it "leaks" out and is available everywhere inside that function.

        b. let and const are Block-Scoped: They only exist inside the curly braces {} where they were created. This is much safer.



2. Reassignment and Redeclaration
        var: You can change the value and even redeclare the same variable name in the same script without an error. (Very messy!)

        let: You can change the value (reassign), but you cannot redeclare it in the same scope.
