A promise is an object of js that represents the eventual results of the asynchronous operations, i.e either success or failure.

a promise is an engine 
    -we can build that engine by ourselves manually using new promise()
    -we can let the js engine handle promise itself by using async function

   
   
    🚨 Important distinction (this matters)

new Promise() → create a promise

async/await → consume a promise (or auto-create one)

You still need promises underneath.
async doesn’t replace promises — it uses them.
